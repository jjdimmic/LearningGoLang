# LearningGoLang

-----Project Purpose------
Creating a project to help understand the fundamentals of Go language
Will be interesting to see how i can apply some of my game engine concepts in this language from my previous Java project.
I want to explore what its like to use a graphics library in this language vs others.
I am also going to use this project as an opportunity to review classic data structures, algorithms, and code optimizing techniques.
